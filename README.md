# RBFNeuralNetwork
This is a radial basis function neural network using the scikit-learn project tutorial. (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

The Python script in this project is the script you have to use with the scikit learn project in order to get a rbf basis network trained and ready to pass some tests, using the databases provided. You can use your own databases, but you have to split them in training and testing sets. (75%-25% is good enough)

The PDF file explains some experiments that have been done with the script with some databases ant the script itself. It's only in Spanish thought, but I will translate it as soon as I can :)
